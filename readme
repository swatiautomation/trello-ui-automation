# ðŸ§ª Trello UI Automation Test with Playwright

This project automates a comprehensive UI test scenario on [Trello](https://trello.com) using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. It creates a new board, adds lists and cards, labels and attaches a PDF, moves a card between lists, and validates all steps along the way.

## ðŸš€ What This Test Does

1. **Logs in** to Trello using credentials stored in environment variables.
2. **Creates a board** named `QA Scrum Board - SS - <timestamp>`.
3. **Creates 3 lists**: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`.
4. **Adds a card** to each list.
5. Adds a **description** and a **green label** to the "To Do Card".
6. **Attaches a PDF** file (`test-document.pdf`) to the "To Do Card".
7. **Drags and drops the card** from "To Do" â†’ "In Progress" â†’ "Done", verifying the move.
8. Produces a **Playwright HTML report**.
